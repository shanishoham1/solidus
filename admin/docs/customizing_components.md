# Customizing components

Solidus Admin uses [view components](https://viewcomponent.org/) to render the views. Components are
a pattern for breaking up the view layer into small, reusable pieces, easy to
reason about and test.

All the components Solidus Admin uses are located in the [`app/components`](../app/components) folder of the
`solidus_admin` gem. As you can see, they are organized in a particular folder structure:

- All of them are under the `SolidusAdmin` namespace.
- They are grouped in sidecar directories, where the main component file and
  all its related files (assets, i18n files, etc.) live together.

Solidus Admin components are designed to be easily customizable by the host
application. Because of that, if you look at how they are designed, you'll find
a series of patterns are followed consistently:

- Components are always resolved from a global registry in
  `SolidusAdmin::Config.components` instead of being referenced by their constant.
- It's possible to override the registry locally inside a component by redefining
  the `#component` method. This is useful when you need to use a component that
  is not registered in the global registry or need to address some edge case.
- In any case, Solidus Admin components initializers only take keyword
  arguments.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so let's depict how this works with an
example:

```ruby
# app/components/solidus_admin/foo/component.rb
class SolidusAdmin::Foo::Component < SolidusAdmin::BaseComponent
  def component(key)
    return MyApplication::Bar::Component if key == 'bar'

    super
  end

  erb_template <<~ERB
    <div>
      <%= render component('bar').new %>
    </div>
  ERB
end
# render component('foo').new
```

### Replacing a component's template

In the most typical case, you'll only need to replace the template used by a
component. You can do that by creating a new component with a maching path in
your application, inheriting from the default one. Then, you can create a new
template for it. For example, to replace the menu item template:

```rb
# app/components/my_admin/navigation/item/component.rb
class MyAdmin::Navigation::Item::Component < SolidusAdmin::Layout::Navigation::Item::Component
end
```

```erb
<%# app/components/my_admin/navigation/item/component.html.erb %>
<li><%= link_to @item.name, path %></li>
```

### Prepending or appending to a component's template

In some situations, you might only need to add some markup before or after a
component. You can easily do that by rendering the Solidus Admin component and
adding your markup before or after it.

```erb
<%# app/components/my_admin/menu_item/component.html.erb %>
<h1>MY STORE ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<%= render SolidusAdmin::MenuItem::Component.new %>
```

### Replacing a component

You can replace a component by creating a new one with a matching path in your
application.

There are two considerations to keep in mind:

- Be aware that other components might be using the component you're replacing.
  They should only be using its `#initialize` method, so make sure to keep
  compatibility with it when they're called.
- Solidus Admin's components always inherit from
  [SolidusAdmin::BaseComponent](../app/components/solidus_admin/base_component.rb).
  You can consider doing the same if you need to use one of its helpers.

For example, the following replaces the menu item component:

```ruby
# app/components/my_admin/menu_item/component.rb
class MyAdmin::MenuItem::Component < SolidusAdmin::BaseComponent
  # Here goes your code
end
```

If you need more control, you can explicitly register your component in the
Solidus Admin container instead of using an implicit path:

> â“˜  Right now, that will raise an error when the application is reloaded. We
> need to fix it.

```ruby
# config/initalizers/solidus_admin.rb
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  SolidusAdmin::Config.components['ui/button'] = MyApplication::Button::Component
end
```

### Tweaking a component

If you only need to tweak a component, you can always inherit from it in a
matching path from within your application (or manually add it to the
registry) and override the methods you need to change:

```ruby
# app/components/my_admin/menu_item/component.rb
class MyAdmin::MenuItem::Component < SolidusAdmin::MenuItem::Component
  def sorted_items
    super.reverse
  end
end
```

Be aware that this approach comes with an important trade-off: You'll need to
keep your component in sync with the original one as it changes on future updates.
For instance, in the example above, the component is overriding a private
method, so there's no guarantee that it will continue to exist in the future
without being deprecated, as we only guarantee public API stability.
